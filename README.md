# Mobile Development Coursework: Name Badge - Part 1

## Sep 2024 - Jan 2025

## Associated with University of London

## Introduction

Run Online on Expo Snack - https://snack.expo.dev/@maryam222/namebadge

This React Native mini midterm project (part 1 out of 4) is designed to help developers grasp the fundamentals of React Native by creating a landscape-oriented "Hello, my name is..." badge application. The project covers key concepts like custom text styling, responsive layout creation, and the use of components. Personalization options, such as adding names, pronouns, emojis, or translations, allow for creative expression while building an engaging app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Node.js** (with npm - Node Package Manager)  
   You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).  
2. **Android Studio and Emulator** (if testing on an Android device)  
   Follow the official setup guide here: [Expo Docs - Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).  
3. **Expo CLI** (Command-Line Interface)  
   Used to simplify app development and testing.

### Setting Up Expo

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Install Expo CLI globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

3. Verify installation with:

   ```bash
   expo --version
   ```

### Running the App

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Mobile-Development-University-of-London-Name-Badge-Part-1
   ```

2. Run the command to install the needed packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the Expo developer tools in your default browser, providing you with options to test the app.

4. You can run the app in the following ways:
   - **Simulators:**  
     Use the displayed options to run the app on an Android or iOS simulator if they're set up.  
   - **Physical Device:**  
     Scan the QR code shown in the Expo developer tools as seen in the image below, using the **Expo Go** app. You can download it for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent).

5. The app should now be running on your device or simulator!

### Troubleshooting

- If the app fails to start, ensure that no other processes are occupying the port (default is 19000). You can stop any running process by pressing `CTRL+C` in your terminal.
- For additional help, refer to the [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).

You should now see the app running correctly on your device/simulator!
